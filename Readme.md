#  Manual building vite project

## Running this project

This repo was building by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) + [React](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-5hwepw?file=index.html&terminal=dev).

The dev server runs on port `5173` by default, but will use another if `5173` is
being used by another application.

- Clone the repo.
- Navigate into the project folder.
- Run `npm i` to download the project's dependencies listed in the `package.json`.
- Run `npx vite` or `npm run dev` (for reactapp) to compile the React project and spin up the app on `http://localhost:5173`.
